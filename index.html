                    <h6>January 2020 - May 2020 | Boston, MA</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            I planned and built an iOS app called Forget-Me-Not for helping people with depression and 
                            bipolar disorder. Inspired by my own struggles with depression, the app functions as a journal 
                            and mood tracker, and I plan to add medication tracking/reminders, a self-care exercise list, 
                            and a progress report generator to send summaries to counselors and loved ones.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I began the project after my application for the Spark! Innovation Fellowship was accepted in 
                            September 2019. I used the semester to plan and start the project by interviewing target users, 
                            examining competitors, and begin coding using storyboards, but found that coding the app was more 
                            beneficial for both my learning and the project's long-term maintenance.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I coded the app itself in Swift and using a model-view-controller (MVC) architecture.
                            I applied to funding opportunities including BU's BUild Lab Idea Cup (for which we won 3rd place) 
                            and New Venture Competition (for which I was a semifinalist). As a health-based 
                            app, I also met with the BU and MIT startup law clinic to guarantee my app was compliant with HIPAA.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Software Engineer Intern at Drift.com</h4>
                    <h6>July 2019 - December 2019 | Boston, MA</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            I built the prototype for the Drift Video app on Android using Kotlin in Android Studio. 
                            While building it from scratch, I referenced the existing iOS app to guarantee existing 
                            use cases were replicated and reliably implemented. Completion of this project set the 
                            foundation for reaching countless new customers who use Android devices.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            While building the app in Android, I implemented the OkHttp and CameraX libraries to handle 
                            HTTP requests/JSON parsing and video recording respectively. I then veriﬁed HTTP request/response 
                            correctness using the Postman tool.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Afterward, I did quality assurance and front end development by building comprehensive test 
                            suites for Drift's iOS app. I programmed these tests using the XCUITest framework in Xcode and 
                            have prevented bugs from shipping to production, which upheld Drift's high quality standards.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I finished my internship coding front end components like the login and video detail views in 
                            Swift. I coded from scratch for some and edited other existing views to fit new UI designs. 
                            All components were coded using the MVC architecture and the RxSwift library.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Technical Intern at Siemens AG</h4>
                    <h6>September 2017 - March 2019 | Orlando, FL</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            I coded back-end triggers and classes to automate data processing in the company’s Salesforce 
                            environment, which has saved countless hours and overhead costs by automating processes that 
                            were previously performed by hand (e.g. data entry and invalid data removal in the wind energy 
                            division) using the Java-like Apex and SQL-like SOQL languages.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When Siemens teams needed maintenance requests, their forms would sometimes pass invalid data 
                            into the back end. To rectify this, I created and refactored forms using the HTML-like Visualforce 
                            language and modified the existing back end code to filter invalid data and work more efficiently.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            I've attended several trainings and panels about creating a more inclusive workspace, and have also 
                            participated in volunteer events to develop technological resources for ally organizations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Participated in July 2020 Digital Corps website development sprint, designing and building a website for 
                            a nonprofit ally organization by using built-in Wordpress tools alongside custom HTML and CSS elements.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Currently serve as a mentor for a junior computer science student as part of OiT's 8-week Digital Mentorship 
                            series. In this role, I meet with the student weekly to help them complete a project and develop technical skills.

                    <h4>Wallbreakers Trainee Mentor</h4>
                    <h6>October 2019 - March 2020 | Remote</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            I completed the Wallbreakers training program from April to June 2019 and loved it! During my time as a trainee, 
                            I <a href="https://github.com/ishfulthinking/LeetCode-problems">shared my answers</a> to help other students debug 
                            their code and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1clBU6vYIjnBrMDwNJrcUR0yY4bVTQXKBk45s9NBrvNU/edit?usp=sharing">created a guide</a> 
                            to problem submission via Git for newbies.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Having been a previous trainee at Wallbreakers and at Facebook Cambridge's Above & Beyond Computer Science program, I 
                            know how helpful these trainings can be and wanted to give back by helping teach the incoming Wallbreakers class.
                        </li> 
                            I held weekly online office hours where I guided students through Leetcode problems to strengthen their grasps on 
                            algorithm analysis and data structures, both of which related directly to their future careers in software engineering.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I did resume reviews upon request, especially before students were referred to companies by the program coordinators. 
                            I also conducted mock interviews with these students to strengthen both their technical and soft skills.
                        </li>

                    <h4>Co-Founder and Membership Coordinator for QLatinx</h4>
                    <h6>July 2016 - October 2018</h6>
                    <p>OK, this one isn't CS-related, but it's something I'm very proud of!</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            After the Pulse Nightclub tragedy in June of 2016, I met with community members to develop ways to support the 
                            Latinx and LGBTQ communities. We built this nonprofit together and met weekly to hold workshops, health fairs, 
                            and develop activism/advocacy skills in our membership. Since then, it's grown large and has been recognized nationally!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I created and developed the <i>Community Cocina</i> cooking class series in which I worked with a local chef to cook 
                            Latin American countries' signature dishes and teach the community about Latinx culture. The program was accessible to all 
                            and grew to be our most popular program, serving hundreds of people over its lifetime. It ran monthly and still runs to this day!
