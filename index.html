                <p>I should start off with my schooling, since I'm spending a lot of money for the 
                    special piece of paper they hand me when I walk across the stage.</p>
                <h4>B.A. in Computer Science from Boston University</h4>

                    <li>
                        Completed coursework includes algorithm analysis, data structures,

                <h1>Work Experience</h1>
                <p>I hold two internships under my belt and have coded in both the front-end and back-end:</p>
                <h4>Software Engineer Intern at Drift.com</h4>
                <h6>July 2019 - Present | Boston, MA</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            I built the prototype for the Drift Video app on Android using Kotlin in Android Studio. 
                            While building it from scratch, I referenced the existing iOS app to guarantee existing 
                            use cases were replicated and reliably implemented. Completion of this project set the 
                            foundation for reaching countless new customers who use Android devices.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            While building the app in Android, I implemented the OkHttp and CameraX libraries to handle 
                            HTTP requests/JSON parsing and video recording respectively. I then veriﬁed HTTP request/response 
                            correctness using the Postman tool.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I currently do quality assurance and front end development by building comprehensive test 
                            suites for Drift's iOS app. These tests are coded using the XCUITest framework on Xcode and 
                            have prevented bugs from shipping to production, which upholds Drift's high quality standards.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>Technical Intern at Siemens AG</h4>
                <h6>July 2019 - Present | Orlando, FL</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            I coded back-end triggers and classes to automate data processing in the company’s Salesforce 
                            environment, which has saved countless hours and overhead costs by automating processes that 
                            were previously performed by hand (e.g. data entry and invalid data removal in the wind energy 
                            division) using the Java-like Apex and SQL-like SOQL languages.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When Siemens teams needed maintenance requests, their forms would sometimes pass invalid data 
                            into the back end. To rectify this, I created and refactored forms using the HTML-like Visualforce 
                            language and modified the existing back end code to filter invalid data and work more efficiently.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                            After the Pulse Nightclub tragedy in June of 2016, I met with community members to develop ways to support the 
                            Latinx and LGBTQ communities. We built this nonprofit together and met weekly to hold workshops, health fairs, 
                            and develop activism/advocacy skills in our membership. Since then, it's grown large and has been recognized nationally!

                        <li>
                            I created and developed the <i>Community Cocina</i> cooking class series in which I worked with a local chef to cook 
                            Latin American countries' signature dishes and teach the community about Latinx culture. The program was accessible to all 
                            and grew to be our most popular program, serving hundreds of people over its lifetime. It ran monthly and still runs to this day!
